# Todo

- [ ] Implement a `format` function with format specifiers.
- [x] Implement a `input`/`read` function to prompt the user for information.
- [ ] Implement a `copy` to copy a value, table etc.
- [ ] Implement single `-` and `/`. Single `-` should return negative  of a number, single `/` should return reciprocal.
- [ ] Implement 'mod', 'rem', 'floor', 'ceil'
- [ ] Complete the implementation for 'tables'
- [ ] Think about support for '<=' and '>='
- [ ] Think about multi-argument '>', '<', etc. Just like Common Lisp
- [ ] Think about mutli-argument '='
- [x] Add 'minusp' and 'plusp', 'evenp' and 'oddp'. Preferably add as stdlib!
- [x] Think about implementing quote-strings. Basically `'hello-world` would be parsed as `"hello-world"`. Basically any identifier( or maybe number ?) prefixed by a quote!. Useful for hashes and other stuff.
